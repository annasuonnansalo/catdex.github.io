                <h2>10. American Wirehair – $1200</h2>
                <p>The American Wirehair originates from upstate New York and is one of the rarest breeds in the United States. In 2003, there were only 22 cats of this breed registered with the Cat Fanciers’ Association and it is currently ranked in last position of the association’s list of breeds. This breed is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair and this mutation was first known to occur in Vernon, upstate New York, in 1966. Physically, the appearance of an American Wirehair is the same as an American Shorthair, with the exception of its springy and wiry coat. It has a similar texture to that of wirehaired terrier dog breeds. Most American Wirehairs have golden eyes, with the exception of white cats which usually have blue or amber eyes. This breed is available in a wide spectrum of colors, but some are not accepted at competition. These include lilac, chocolate, and Himalayan.</p>

                <h2>9. American Curl – $1200</h2>
                <p>The American Curl is another cat that is the result of a spontaneous mutation. They originate from Lakewood, California, in 1981 and are distinctive because of their unusually shaped curled ears. This medium sized cat comes in both long and short haired varieties and weighs between five and ten pounds. A strange fact about this breed is that the kittens are born with straight ears that begin to curl within 48 hours of their birth. There are also strict rules about the angles of the curl. Show cats must have ears that curl to an angle between 90 and 180 degrees. However, too much curl is a bad thing because the cat will be disqualified from a competition if its ears touch the back of its skull. The American Curl has a soft and silky coat that lies flat against its body.</p>

                <h2>3. The Bengal – $5000</h2>
                <p>The Bengal cat is a domestic cat that was deliberately bred to resemble a wild jungle cat. The exact origins of the breed are not known. However, the first mention of a domestic cat crossed with an Asian Leopard cat was in 1889. The first officially confirmed cat that was a hybrid of an Asian leopard cat and a domestic cat was in 1934. These cats are called the Bengal cat because the taxonomic name of an Asian leopard is the bengalensis. The characteristics of the Bengal cat include a white belly, large markings, and a body shape that is similar to, but smaller than, an Asian leopard cat. It is recommended that those who want a Bengal cat for their home should buy a fourth-generation cat as these have a temperament similar to a domestic cat. The first-generation Bengals are usually kept for breeding purposes as they have a wilder nature.</p>
